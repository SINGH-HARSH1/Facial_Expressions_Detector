An Application to Detect Facial Expressions
<li>Created By - Harsh Singh</li>

<h3>Inspiration</h3>
<p>
The project is inspired from the "Challenges in Representation Learning: 
Facial Expression Recognition Challenge", which was hosted on 
<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/overview">Kaggle</a>.
The Project aims to create an application capable to detect facial expressions provided an input from camera and video Sources.

<h3> Datasets </h3>
<p>
The datasets initially used for the Projects were downloaded
from 
<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/data">Kaggle</a>.
Scripts were created to preprocess the csv files to images.
The scripts are present in the utility directory in the
